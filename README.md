# CIND-820-Big-Data-Analytics-Project

The objective of this big data analytics project is to identify the key variables that predict long-term outcomes in people infected with COVID-19 using Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data. BRFSS data is collected annually by the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention; residents of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virigin Islands participate in telephone surveys. 

The research questions of this project are as follows: 

    1.	What factors predict symptoms lasting three months or longer following a COVID-19 infection? 
    2.	Among people who tested positive for COVID-19, what key variables predict frequent mental distress? 
    3.	What factors predict serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions among people who have been infected with COVID-19? 

The primary outcome variables of interest are <b> COVIDSMP </b>, <b> MENTHLTH </b>, and <b> DECIDE </b>, which represent the answers to the questions <i>Did you have any symptoms lasting 3 months or longer that you did not have prior to having coronavirus or COVID-19? </i>, <i>Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?</i>, and <i> Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions? </i>, respectively. The <b> MENTHLTH </b> variable will be dichotimized using a threshold of 14 days, as 14 or more days of mentally unhealthy days is commonly used as a measure of frequent mental distress, which is associated with mental disorders.
