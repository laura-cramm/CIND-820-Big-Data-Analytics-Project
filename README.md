# CIND-820-Big-Data-Analytics-Project

The proposed objective of this big data analytics project is to investigate the relationship between COVID-19 infection and neurological factors using Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data. BRFSS data is collected annually by the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention; residents of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virigin Islands participate in telephone surveys. 

The research questions of this project are as follows: 

    1. Are people who were infected with COVID-19 more likely to have been
    diagnosed with a depressive disorder?

    2. Are people who were infected with COVID-19 more likely to self-report that
    during the past 30 days their mental health (including stress, depression, and
    problems with emotions) was ‘not good’?

    3. Are adults over the age of 45 who were infected with COVID-19 more likely to
    experience confusion or memory loss that is happening more often or is getting
    worse?

In the 2022 BRFSS dataset, the primary exposure variable of interest is <b> COVIDPOS </b>, which is a categorical variable representing the answer to the question: <i> Has a doctor, nurse, or other health professional ever told you that you tested positive for COVID 19? </i> 

The primary outcome variables of interest are <b> MENTHLTH </b>, <b> ADDEPEV3 </b>, and <b> CIMEMLOS </b>, which represent the answers to the questions <i>Now thinking about your mental health, which includes stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good? </i>, <i>(Ever told) (you had) a depressive disorder (including depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression)?</i>, and <i> During the past 12 months, have you experienced confusion or memory loss that is happening more often or is getting worse? </i>, respectively. 

Please note that the BRFSS consists of a standardized core questionnaire that all states are obligated to conduct, in addition to a series of optional modules and state-added questions. The <b> CIMEMLOS </b> variable is part of the optional <i> Cognitive Decline </i> module, which a total of 18 states decided to administer.
